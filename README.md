Description: <br />
Cryptic is a web application that allows users to search and find the latest information and statistics for the cryptocurrency of their choosing. Users are also able to save a cryptocurrency to their watchlist where they can later view the statistics of the cryptocurrency at the time that it was added to their personal watchlist. From there, Cryptic users can sort their watchlist in two ways. One, they can sort by alphabetical order, date added, or statistical data such as: price, market cap, and volume. Two, they can choose if they would like their watchlist presented in an ascending order or a descending order. In addition, users are able to view information on their Cryptic account through the profile page where they can view the username, email, and first and last name that are associated with the account. <br /> <br />

Features: <br />
- Account System <br /> 
  I wanted to make a personalized experience for each specific user and to implement some of the features listed below this was the best method.
- Searchbar for Cryptocurrency Information <br />
  This is the backbone of the application that allows users to find information on the different cryptocurrencies.
- Dropdown Input to choose fiat currency that cryptocurrency statistics will be converted to <br />
  I also wanted to make Cryptic an application that many people could use, so I added the option for a user to change the conversion currency between the globe's top 20 fiat currencies.
- Watchlist System <br />
I built Cryptic to be a tool that cryptocurrency investors could use, and this expands upon that concept. I wanted to add a way for users to view the trends of many cryptocurrencies and some of the historical data for those cryptocurrency projects.
- Sorting Form to sort user's watchlist data <br />
I knew that a watchlist could get very long and cluttered, so I wanted to add an organizational tool that would allow a user to sort their list by a number of different metrics.
